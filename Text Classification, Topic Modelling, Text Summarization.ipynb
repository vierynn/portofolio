        "- Pengambilan model pretraining BERT base uncased\n",
        "- Splitting ke training dan testing data\n",
        "- Preprocessing kolom `text` agar bisa diproses untuk model BERT, yaitu membuat `input_id` dan `attention_mask`\n",
        "- Pengubahan kolom `label` menjadi one-hot encoded vector dengan `LabelEncoder` dan `to_categorical`\n",
        "-  Pembuatan function `objective` optuna dengan mendefine hyperparameter yang mau ditune, modelnya, dan hasil evaluasi dari training modelnya. Hyperparameter yang dituning adalah learning rate dan epoch karena berpengaruh pada modelnya, dimana learning rate adalah besar perubahan yang dilakukan pada weights modek, dan epoch adalah jumlah iterasi dari training set. Pada proses ini juga akan dilakukan proses finetuning yang menyesuaikan model untuk tugas text classification.\n",

Akurasi dari model BERT dengan hyperparameter tersebut adalah sekitar 96.471%. Artinya untuk testing dataset berhasil terklasfikasi secara akurat sebanyak 96.471%.\n"

            "Innovation is playing an increasing role in services (Miles, 2001) and, unquestionably, is particularly important for the tourism industry (Hjalager, 2002)\n",
            "Tourism has been one of the main drivers of Internet use in the economy – from e-commerce to inter-firm relations or Web 2.0 applications (Marcussen, 2009, Werthner and Klein, 2005)\n",
            "Buhalis and Law (2008:610) indicate that “technological progress and tourism have been going hand in hand for years”\n",

            "Indeed, the tourism industry is comprised of activities that are scattered in nature, time and space, which need to be combined and assembled dynamically, and gather together actors located far apart in the physical, organisational, as well as cognitive senses\n",
            "Among the knowledge transfer mechanisms identified in the literature, learning via observation is particularly important for tourism firms given the difficulties of patenting intellectual capital and of concealing innovations in the “front of house” (Hall & Williams, 2008)\n",
            "Weidenfeld, Williams, and Butler (2010:5) describe that “services generally rely less on in-house research and development and more on buying in knowledge and innovations from suppliers”\n",

            "Indeed, the tourism industry is comprised of activities that are scattered in nature, time and space, which need to be combined and assembled dynamically, and gather together actors located far apart in the physical, organisational, as well as cognitive senses\n",
            "Among the knowledge transfer mechanisms identified in the literature, learning via observation is particularly important for tourism firms given the difficulties of patenting intellectual capital and of concealing innovations in the “front of house” (Hall & Williams, 2008)\n",
            "Weidenfeld, Williams, and Butler (2010:5) describe that “services generally rely less on in-house research and development and more on buying in knowledge and innovations from suppliers”\n",
            "The role of fairs is thus very important since they represent a locus of diffusion of information on the nature of the ongoing innovation processes\n",
            "They can put forward the evolution of “frontiers” related to the different dimensions of innovation in tourism\n",
            "The analysis is structured as follows\n",
            "Section 2 introduces the case study and builds the analytical framework required for the empirical analysis\n",
            "Tourism is defined as a sectoral system of innovation and production, a concept introduced by Malerba, 2001, Malerba, 2004, which identifies the constraints related to innovation in this activity\n",
            "Section 3 presents the Tourism@ case study, the methodology and statistical analysis\n",
            "This case study benefits from an exhaustive database of the innovation projects presented at Tourism@, which provides information on knowledge bases, technologies, and the uses and markets targeted over time\n",
            "The analysis of the Tourism@ trade fair database in Section 4 reveals the important innovative activity that occurs in the tourism industry\n",
            "It highlights the capacity of this industry to rapidly exploit the advantages of the newest technological developments\n",
            "Section 5 concludes.\n"
